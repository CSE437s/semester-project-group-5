          <strong>Article 26</strong> in The UN Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has
          the right to education. As a team of minorities, we have experienced the effects of
          financial literacy not being held to this same standard.
          <br />
          <br />
          The <strong>Financial Phenotype Test</strong>, similar to the Myers Briggs personality
          test, is a tool we've developed to help individuals understand their unique financial
          personality. By understanding one's <strong>financial phenotype</strong>, individuals can
          gain insights into their financial tendencies, strengths, and areas for improvement,
          enabling them to make more informed financial decisions and build healthier financial
          habits.
          <br />
          <br />
          Leveraging <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>, we intend to provide
          personalized financial guidance tailored to each user's distinct financial phenotype.
          Through a chatbot trained on the principles of behavioral economics and financial
          psychology, as well as one's personal financial tendencies, users will receive AI-powered
          advice catered specifically to their financial tendencies.
